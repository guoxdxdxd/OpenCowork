## [0.7.13] - 2026-04-06

### Added

- Added support for the latest application update to include additional runtime safety checks before release checks.
- Added improvements to updater behavior under mixed network conditions.

### Changed

- Bumped the app version to `v0.7.13`.
- Updated the docs homepage release badge from `v0.7.12` to `v0.7.13`.

### Fixed

- Improved update package delivery fallback behavior.

### Notes

- This release focuses on update pipeline stability and minor UX/behavior consistency updates around release checks.

## [0.7.10] - 2026-03-30

### Added

- Expanded the `.NET` sidecar role so more provider and message-processing work now runs outside the Electron layer.
- Added shared normalization and replay handling in the provider pipeline to support continued runs and backend-side message shaping.
- Added a reusable code diff viewer in the renderer so file change cards and tool call cards share the same diff presentation.

### Changed

- Moved provider formatting, tool output shaping, and stream replay responsibilities into the `.NET` backend path.
- Consolidated renderer diff rendering around the new shared viewer to reduce duplication between chat cards.
- Bumped the app version to `v0.7.10`.
- Updated the docs homepage release badge from `v0.7.9` to `v0.7.10`.

### Fixed

- Improved OpenAI streaming replay so continued runs preserve tool calls, assistant messages, and formatting more reliably.
- Tightened provider message formatting for tool results and multimodal payloads to reduce replay mismatches and compatibility issues.
- Reduced divergence between the renderer and backend by normalizing more of the message shape in the `.NET` provider layer.

### Notes

- This release continues the backend migration work: more logic has moved from the renderer-facing path into the `.NET` sidecar to make provider handling more consistent and easier to evolve.

## [0.7.9] - 2026-03-30


### Added

- Added a long-running mode for autonomous sessions so the agent can persist this preference per session, auto-answer `AskUserQuestion`, and continue iterating until the work is verified complete.

### Fixed

- Forwarded refs in the shared `Select` primitives to improve Radix integration reliability across renderer UI surfaces.
- Improved the app plugin settings panel so unconfigured plugins resolve state safely instead of failing on missing setup data.
- Preserved nested preview panel height constraints to avoid layout regressions in the renderer preview area.
- Sent `Chatgpt-Account-Id` for OpenAI Responses account-backed requests and included `account_id` in exported provider account JSON.

### Changed

- Bumped the app version to `v0.7.8`.
- Updated the docs homepage release badge from `v0.7.7` to `v0.7.8`.

## [0.7.7] - 2026-03-29

### Changed

- Bumped the app version to `v0.7.7`.
- Updated the docs homepage release badge from `v0.7.6` to `v0.7.7`.

## [0.7.6] - 2026-03-29

### Added

- Added `MiMo V2 Omni` and `MiMo V2 Pro` built-in Xiaomi model presets.

### Changed

- Remembered `reasoning effort` per model so chat and wiki generation can reuse the selected thinking level for each model.
- Updated the docs homepage release badge from `v0.7.5` to `v0.7.6`.

### Fixed

- Stopped filtering legacy built-in models globally so provider presets can control deprecated model visibility explicitly.

## [0.7.5] - 2026-03-29

### Fixed

- Stopped excluding `partial-json` from the packaged app so the main process can resolve it at startup; fixes `Cannot find module 'partial-json'` after install on Windows and other platforms.

- Updated the docs homepage release badge from `v0.7.4` to `v0.7.5`.

## [0.7.4] - 2026-03-29

### Added

- Added direct project creation from selected local folders by reusing the working-folder picker across workspace entry points.

### Changed

- Synced the Bun lockfile with the current dependency set.
- Added a sponsors section to both `README.md` and `README.zh.md`.
- Updated the docs homepage release badge from `v0.7.3` to `v0.7.4`.

### Fixed

- Normalized provider and model selection by category so chat, draw, translate, plugin, and settings pickers prefer enabled providers that are ready for authentication.
- Stabilized chat message list auto-scroll so streaming output stays visible without causing unnecessary jumps while browsing history.
- Fixed Weixin media API requests by forwarding `X-WECHAT-UIN` to upload and download endpoints used by media operations.

## [0.7.3] - 2026-03-27

### Changed

- Improved chat composer and settings layouts with better input height calculation, file editor spacing, provider organization, and clearer SubAgent error presentation.

- Recovered Weixin message polling after remote session timeouts by resetting the polling cursor and retry cadence automatically.
- Kept embedded SubAgent execution details in a single-column layout for more stable rendering.

## [0.7.2] - 2026-03-26

- Updated the docs homepage release badge from `v0.7.1` to `v0.7.2`.
